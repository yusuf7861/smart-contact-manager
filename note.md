## Prerequisites

### 1. Configure Tailwind CSS

#### Tailwind CSS Configuration (`tailwind.config.js`)

To get Tailwind CSS working with your Spring Boot application, you need to configure it properly. Here’s a basic configuration for Tailwind that scans your Thymeleaf and static files for utility classes.

```js
module.exports = {
  content: [
    './src/main/resources/templates/**/*.html', // Thymeleaf templates
    './src/main/resources/static/**/*.js',      // Static JS files
  ],
  theme: {
    extend: {}, // Extend Tailwind's default theme if needed
  },
  plugins: [], // You can add Tailwind plugins here
};
```

### 2. Compile Tailwind CSS

To compile your custom Tailwind CSS, you can use the following command. This command will take your input CSS file, process it with Tailwind, and output the compiled CSS.

```bash
[npx tailwindcss -i src/main/resources/static/css/input.css -o src/main/resources/static/css/output.css --watch
```

- Replace `input.css` with your actual source CSS file.
- The `--watch` flag ensures that any changes you make are immediately reflected in the output CSS during development.

### 3. Dark and Light Theme with Flowbite

Flowbite is a component library built on Tailwind CSS, and it also offers dark and light theme functionality. Here's how to include it:

#### Include Flowbite CSS in Your Project

Add the Flowbite CSS CDN in your `<head>` tag of your HTML/Thymeleaf files:

```html
<link href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/flowbite@2.5.1/dist/flowbite.min.css" rel="stylesheet" />
```

#### Include Flowbite JavaScript

Include the Flowbite JavaScript just before the closing `</body>` tag to enable the interactive components:

```html
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/flowbite@2.5.1/dist/flowbite.min.js"></script>
```

This allows you to use components such as modals, dropdowns, and toggles with dark and light themes in your Spring Boot app.

### 4. Using Thymeleaf Fragments

Thymeleaf fragments help reduce repetition by allowing you to reuse common components (such as headers, footers, or any reusable HTML block) across different templates.

#### Declaring a Fragment

Here’s an example of how to declare a Thymeleaf fragment in a file, say `base.html`:

```html
<div th:fragment="parent(x, y)">
    <h1>This is a parent fragment located in the base.html page</h1>
    <p>Fragments reduce the need for repetitive code. Use them in any HTML file to streamline your templates.</p>
    <p><span th:text="${x}"></span></p>
</div>
```

#### Using a Fragment in Another File

To insert a fragment declared in another file, use the `th:insert` or `th:replace` attributes. Here’s an example of using the fragment from `base.html` in another file:

```html
<!-- `base` is the file where the fragment is declared, and `parent` is the fragment's name -->
<div th:insert="~{base :: parent('one', 'two')}"></div>
```

- `th:insert` adds the fragment into the current tag.
- `th:replace` replaces the current tag with the fragment content.

Fragments help in maintaining consistency and DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principles in your application.
